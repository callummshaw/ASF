#Assuming a birth pulse for seasonal births (exp(-bw*cos(t*pi/365 +bo)^2)), variable determines width of pulse 0 is uniform births and 365 is a sharp spike
Birth_width,5
#Adjust peak of seasonal births...
Birth_offset,60
#Now looking at decay, here we have seasonal varation from mean
Decay_amp,20
#Now start date, offset for hemisphere, 0 is maximum (cosine function) and 182.5 is minimum
Decay_offset,0
